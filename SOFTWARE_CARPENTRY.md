# Software Carpentry
## Overview
This document contains information as to how Software Carpentry (SC) workshops 
hosted by CyVerse are conducted at the University of Arizona.

Throughout the rest of these pages, these workshops will be referred to as
"CyVerse workshops".

Since these are _Software Carpentry_ workshops, you should assume that they
will adhere to the [Software Carpentry documentation][sc]. The rest of this
documentation will reference the SC docs, and any deviations to the docs will
be called out.

## Workshop Roles
The SC website defines [workshop operations], which includes definitions for
the roles involved in running a workshop, as well as checklists for each role. 

For CyVerse workshops, the `host` responsibilities are handled by the `admin` role. 
Furthermore, some of the `lead instructor` checklist items are handled by the 
`admin`, and vice versa.
