# General
* Workshop links
  * [Workshop GitHub Repo](https://github.com/strootman/2016-11-05-Tucson)
  * [Workshop Site](https://strootman.github.io/2016-11-05-Tucson/)
  * If you are not a collaborator on the repo, contact jstroot@cyverse.org
* At the beginning of the workshop, attendees will be grouped into pairs, for pair programming.
* The workshop will use [formative assesments], which are split into two groups; `general` and `specific`.
  * `General` formative assesments will be taken, at minumum, every time the students break from the classroom.
  * `Specific` formative assesments are subject to Instructor discretion, but are intended to be complementary to the concept maps created for the lesson _(see Actions below)_
  * This will, most likely, require more red and green sticky notes than usual. ;)
* There will not be a git-specific module taught for the workshop.
* Upendra out `Oct 19-29`

# 1 - Actions
## 1.1 - Everyone
* The [shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice), [git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice), and [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation) [lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder) will follow the [Software Carpentry lesson plans](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
  * Please review your respective lessons
* Review the [Software Carpentry Instructor Training](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training)
* Each instructor team will create concept maps for their lessons, and send them out to the rest of the team. This includes the "git exercise" and capstone.
  * Concept maps are due: `Wed by 10 AM.`, preferable _earlier_.
  * Concept maps will be checked into the [_prep/concept_maps/](https://github.com/strootman/2016-11-05-Tucson/tree/gh-pages/_prep/concept_maps) directory of the workshop repo.

## 1.2 - Strootman
* Get shell scripts for splitting gapminder data into "shell lesson compatible format" to Tania and Marnee.
* I wrote down the action, `"look into cleaning ...."` in my meeting notes. I didn't get to finish. Can someone please let me know what this was? :p

# Misc Notes
* Git
  * Discussion regarding the combining of the the "git exercise" with the capstone.
  * Connor identified the concept of the "git stage" as the most critical to establish
* We will evaluate using a common data set for the workshop. Most likely the gapminder data set.
* R Lesson
  * There are 2 [R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation) [lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder). Upendra and Asher must choose one or the other (or present another option to the group for discussion).
